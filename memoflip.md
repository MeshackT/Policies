Privacy Policy – MemoFlip

Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how MemoFlip collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application. MemoFlip is a free memory game app developed to provide users with an engaging card-matching game experience.

By using this Service, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

Information Collection and Use
MemoFlip does not require users to register or provide personal information to play the game. The app may store game progress, scores, or preferences locally on your device or securely in cloud services (e.g., Hive, Firebase) to enhance gameplay experience.

No personal data is collected for marketing purposes, and your information is not shared with any third party except as necessary for app functionality (e.g., push notifications).

Notifications
MemoFlip may use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send notifications related to game updates, new levels, or features. Notifications are sent through a topic-based system and do not contain personal information. You may opt-out of receiving notifications at any time through the app settings.

No Purchases or Subscriptions
MemoFlip is completely free to use. The app does not offer in-app purchases, subscriptions, or paid services. We do not sell or monetize user data in any form.

Cookies and Tracking
MemoFlip does not use cookies explicitly. However, third-party libraries used for analytics, ads, or notifications may collect non-identifiable information to improve app performance. No tracking across devices occurs.

Device Information
The app may collect device-specific information such as device type, operating system, and screen size only for performance optimization. This data is anonymous and used solely to enhance the gameplay experience.

Third-Party Services
MemoFlip may integrate services like Firebase for notifications or Hive for local data storage. All collected data remains under the control of the developer and is never sold to third parties.

Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no electronic storage or transmission is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Children’s Privacy
MemoFlip is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal data, we will delete it immediately. Parents or guardians may contact us if they believe their child has used the app.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and are effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
